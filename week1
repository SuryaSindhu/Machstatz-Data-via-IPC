Inter-process communication (IPC): 
           It is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of co-operation between them. 
Processes can communicate with each other through both: Shared Memory. Message passing.

Networking:
          Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

List of modules:
asyncio — Asynchronous I/O
socket — Low-level networking interface
ssl — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects
select — Waiting for I/O completion
selectors — High-level I/O multiplexing
asyncore — Asynchronous socket handler
asynchat — Asynchronous socket command/response handler
signal — Set handlers for asynchronous events
mmap — Memory-mapped file support
